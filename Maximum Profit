Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int max = 0;//Holds the cummulative profit
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            if(prices[i] > prices[i-1]){//if there's a favorable difference in balance (the next is higher than previous)
                max += prices[i] - prices[i-1];//find the difference and add it to the cummulative variable
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
